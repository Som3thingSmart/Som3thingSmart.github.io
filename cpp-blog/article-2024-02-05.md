First c++ code

:thumbs_up:

```c++
#include<iostream> //basically lets you print (input, output stream)
int main(){ //int is short for integer. because it returns 0 which is an integer, it has to be written next to main.
	std::cout << "hello world\n"; //std is short for standart library, cout is short for character out
	return 0; //0 signifies that nothing went wrong, if anything goes wrong in the program, the output will not be 0	
}
//cd [filepath]
//dir
//g++ -std=c++20 -pedantic -o new new.cc
// .\ or start
```
