This code is designed to evaluate mathematical expressions that are given in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). RPN is a mathematical notation where every operator follows all of its operands. For example, the expression 3 4 + in RPN is equivalent to 3 + 4 in standard notation.

* std::stack<double> numbers;: This line creates a stack called numbers to store the numbers in the expression.

* std::string token;: This line creates a string called token to build up each number as it’s read from the expression.

* for (int i = 0; i < expression.size(); i++) {: This line starts a loop that goes through each character in the expression.

* if (isdigit(expression[i]) || (expression[i] == '-' && isdigit(expression[i+1]))) {: This line checks if the current character is a digit or a negative sign followed by a digit, indicating it’s part of a number.

* while (i < expression.size() && (isdigit(expression[i]) || expression[i] == '.')) {: This line starts a loop that adds each digit to token until it encounters a character that’s not part of the number.

* token += expression[i++];: This line adds the current character to token.

* numbers.push(std::stod(token));: Once the entire number has been read, this line converts it to a double and pushes it onto the numbers stack.

* token.clear();: This line clears token to prepare for the next number.

* if (i < expression.size()) {: This line checks if there are still characters left in the expression to process.

* char op = expression[i];: This line gets the current character and stores it in op.

* if (op == '+' || op == '-' || op == '*' || op == '/' || op == '^') {: This line checks if the current character is an operator.

* double operand2 = numbers.top(); numbers.pop();: This line gets the top number from the stack, stores it in operand2, and removes it from the stack.

* double operand1 = numbers.top(); numbers.pop();: This line does the same for the next number on the stack, storing it in operand1.

* switch(op) {: This line starts a switch statement that performs the operation corresponding to the operator.

* numbers.push(operand1 + operand2);: If the operator is ‘+’, this line adds the two operands and pushes the result onto the stack.

* std::cerr << "Invalid operator: " << op << std::endl;: If the operator is not recognized, this line prints an error message.

* if (!numbers.empty()) {: After all characters in the expression have been processed, this line checks if the numbers stack is empty.

* double result = numbers.top(); numbers.pop();: If the stack is not empty, this line gets the top number from the stack (the final result of the expression), stores it in result, and removes it from the stack.

* return result;: This line returns the final result of the expression.
